```bash
# Create a new engagement
tracker init BoxName

# Switch active engagement
tracker use BoxName

# Track credentials as you find them
tracker cred add admin password123 ssh
tracker cred add admin "" rdp --notes "blank password"

# Log findings
tracker finding add "SQL Injection on login" critical
tracker finding add "Default credentials on admin panel" high

# Record services
tracker service add 80 tcp http "Apache 2.4.38"
tracker service add 3389 tcp rdp "Microsoft Terminal Services"

# View engagement status
