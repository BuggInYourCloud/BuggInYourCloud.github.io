## Overview

A CLI-based engagement tracker built for pentest operators and AI assistants. Manages the full lifecycle of security engagements: scoping, credential tracking, findings, timelines, and report generation. All data stored as flat YAML and Markdown files for easy version control and AI readability.

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new engagement
tracker init BoxName

# Switch active engagement
tracker use BoxName

# Track credentials as you find them
tracker cred add admin password123 ssh
tracker cred add admin "" rdp --notes "blank password"

# Log findings
tracker finding add "SQL Injection on login" critical
tracker finding add "Default credentials on admin panel" high

# Record services
tracker service add 80 tcp http "Apache 2.4.38"
tracker service add 3389 tcp rdp "Microsoft Terminal Services"

# View engagement status
tracker status
tracker timeline

# Generate report
tracker report
```

## Features

- **Engagement lifecycle** — init, scope, track, report across multiple concurrent engagements
- **Credential tracking** — usernames, passwords, hashes with source and validation status
- **Service registry** — ports, protocols, versions discovered during enumeration
- **Finding management** — severity-rated findings with evidence paths
- **Timeline logging** — chronological record of actions and discoveries
- **Methodology checklists** — customisable phase-by-phase tracking
- **Report generation** — Markdown reports from engagement data
- **AI-friendly** — flat YAML/Markdown files readable by Claude and other LLM assistants
- **No dependencies** — pure Bash, runs anywhere
