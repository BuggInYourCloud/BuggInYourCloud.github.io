  <h2>Hey</h2>
  <p>I'm an Aussie getting into cybersecurity. Mostly interested in the red team side of things — social engineering, physical security, the human element. I find people way more interesting to hack than machines, but I do plenty of both.</p>

  <p>Outside of security I mess around with lockpicking, AI stuff, and whatever else catches my attention. I like learning things.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Worked a few desk jobs, decided I wanted to do something I actually cared about. Got my <strong>B.S. in IT</strong> (Cybersecurity & Networking) and <strong>Security+</strong> in 2024. Currently wrapping up a <strong>Master of Cybersecurity</strong> and working toward the <strong>AWS Security Specialty</strong> cert.</p>

  <p>Long term I'd love to help grow the cybersecurity scene in Australia. For now I'm just upskilling and putting in the work.</p>

  <h2>What I'm Into</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Social engineering and the human side of security</li>
    <li>Red teaming</li>
    <li>AI + security (currently fine-tuning an LLM for pentesting)</li>
    <li>Lockpicking</li>
    <li>Building tools when I need something that doesn't exist yet</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current Project</h2>
  <p>Fine-tuning a Qwen3 14B model for cybersecurity — it runs locally on my 3090 through Ollama with a bunch of security tool servers wired up to it. I test it against HTB boxes and use the results to make it better. The write-ups on this site come from that process.</p>
