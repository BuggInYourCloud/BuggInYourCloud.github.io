  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity researcher from Australia with a focus on offensive security and red teaming. I'm drawn to the human side of security — social engineering, physical intrusion, understanding where people's trust breaks down — but I'm equally comfortable in a terminal working through boxes on HackTheBox.</p>
  <p>Security doesn't stop at the network edge. Lockpicking, wardriving, signal cloning — if it can be bypassed, I want to understand how and why.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Came up through a few desk jobs before committing to cybersecurity full-time. Finished my <strong>B.I.T</strong> in Information Technology (Cybersecurity &amp; Networking) at Southern Cross University and earned my <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> in 2024. Currently finishing a <strong>Master of Cybersecurity</strong> (Cloud Security) at the University of Sydney and working toward the <strong>AWS Solutions Architect Associate</strong>.</p>
  <p>The goal is to contribute to Australia's cybersecurity space in a meaningful way — always looking for opportunities where I can keep learning and actually make an impact.</p>

  <h2>What I'm Into</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong> — The human side of security, from phishing to physical intrusion</li>
    <li><strong>Red Teaming</strong> — Full-scope adversary simulation</li>
    <li><strong>Physical Security</strong> — Lockpicking, wardriving, DeAuth, cloning, replay attacks</li>
    <li><strong>Ethics in Cybersecurity</strong> — Responsible disclosure, dual-use tooling, where research meets harm</li>
  </ul>
