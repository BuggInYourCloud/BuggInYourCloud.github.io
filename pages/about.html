  <h2>whoami</h2>
  <p>Red teamer from Australia with a bias toward the human side of security. While most people chase command line mastery, I've always been more drawn to social engineering and manipulation — understanding how people think, where trust breaks down, and how to exploit that gap. The technical skills are the delivery mechanism; the psychology is the actual weapon.</p>

  <p>That said, I'm no stranger to a terminal. I've spent years breaking into boxes on HackTheBox and TryHackMe, building offensive tooling, and more recently fine-tuning LLMs to assist with penetration testing. I'm also the kind of person who picked up lockpicking as a hobby — because sometimes the best way through a door isn't digital.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I came up through a handful of desk jobs before deciding to go all-in on cybersecurity. Completed my <strong>B.S. in Information Technology</strong> (majoring in Cybersecurity and Networking) and picked up my <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> in 2024. Currently finishing my <strong>Master of Cybersecurity</strong> in 2025. The goal is to become a leader in Australia's cybersecurity space — not just another operator, but someone who shapes how the industry thinks about offensive security.</p>

  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong> — Phishing, pretexting, physical intrusion, human vulnerability research</li>
    <li><strong>Red Teaming</strong> — Full-scope adversary simulation, not just "run the scanner"</li>
    <li><strong>AI + Offensive Security</strong> — Fine-tuning LLMs for pentesting, building autonomous security agents</li>
    <li><strong>Lockpicking</strong> — Because physical security is still security</li>
    <li><strong>Tool Development</strong> — If the tool I need doesn't exist, I build it</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What's Here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Write-ups</strong> — Detailed walkthroughs of HackTheBox and TryHackMe machines, from recon to root</li>
    <li><strong>Tools</strong> — Security tools and projects I've built</li>
    <li><strong>Certs</strong> — Professional certifications and academic credentials</li>
    <li><strong>Blog</strong> — Thoughts on offensive security, social engineering, AI, and the industry</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current Project</h2>
  <p>Fine-tuning a Qwen3 14B model specifically for cybersecurity operations — tool calling, reconnaissance, exploitation chains. It runs locally on an RTX 3090 via Ollama, connected to 12 MCP tool servers (nmap, sqlmap, hashcat, radare2, and more). Claude Code acts as the evaluator, observing every command the model makes during live box testing. The write-ups on this site double as benchmark data for the next training run.</p>
