  <h2>whoami</h2>
  <p>Cybersecurity guy from Australia focused on red teaming and offensive security. I've always leaned more toward the human side — social engineering, physical security, understanding where people's trust breaks down — but I spend plenty of time in terminals too, breaking boxes on HackTheBox and TryHackMe and building tooling to make the process better.</p>

  <p>I also picked up lockpicking along the way, because security doesn't stop at the keyboard.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Came up through a few desk jobs before committing to cybersecurity full-time. Finished my <strong>B.S. in Information Technology</strong> (Cybersecurity & Networking) and earned my <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> in 2024. Currently finishing a <strong>Master of Cybersecurity</strong> and working toward the <strong>AWS Security Specialty</strong> cert.</p>

  <p>The goal is to contribute to Australia's cybersecurity space in a meaningful way — always looking for opportunities where I can keep learning and actually make an impact.</p>

  <h2>What I'm Into</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong> — The human side of security, from phishing to physical intrusion</li>
    <li><strong>Red Teaming</strong> — Full-scope adversary simulation</li>
    <li><strong>AI + Security</strong> — Fine-tuning LLMs for offensive security workflows</li>
    <li><strong>Lockpicking</strong> — Physical security is still security</li>
    <li><strong>Tool Development</strong> — Building what I need when it doesn't exist</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current Project</h2>
  <p>Fine-tuning a Qwen3 14B model for cybersecurity operations. It runs locally on an RTX 3090 via Ollama, connected to 12 MCP tool servers for things like nmap, sqlmap, hashcat, and radare2. I benchmark it against live HTB boxes, log every decision the model makes, and feed the results back into training. The write-ups on this site come out of that process.</p>
