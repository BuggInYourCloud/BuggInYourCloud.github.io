## About

CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) is a globally recognized certification validating baseline cybersecurity skills — threat detection, risk management, incident response, and security architecture. The exam tests five core domains:

**General Security Concepts (12%)** — Foundational principles like the CIA triad, zero trust architecture, risk management, security models, and common cybersecurity terminology (CVE, IOC, STIX, TAXII).

**Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations (22%)** — Identifying and defending against threats including malware types (ransomware, spyware), social engineering attacks (phishing, whaling), attack vectors, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.

**Security Architecture (18%)** — Secure system design including network segmentation, DMZs, air gapping, firewall configuration, secure cloud environments, data classification, and cryptography (encryption, hashing, digital signatures, PKI).

**Security Operations (28%)** — Day-to-day security practices: incident response, SIEM and log analysis, SOAR, vulnerability management, patch management, backup strategies, and secure baselines.

**Security Program Management and Oversight (20%)** — Organizational security policies, risk mitigation strategies, compliance frameworks, business continuity planning, third-party risk, and agreement types (SLAs, MOUs).

## Relevance

The industry baseline for cybersecurity roles. Covers the breadth of defensive and offensive concepts that underpin everything from SOC work to penetration testing methodology.
